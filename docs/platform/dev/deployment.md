# Platform Deployment Guide

This document is the short control-plane deployment guide. The full operator runbook is [VPS Deployment Guide](../../dev/vps-deployment.md).

## Current Production Shape

Production Matrix OS is VPS-native:

- one platform/control-plane VPS;
- one customer VPS per active user;
- Matrix gateway, shell, code-server, sync, and app assets run on the customer VPS through host services;
- each customer VPS has its own local Postgres endpoint at `127.0.0.1:5432`;
- customer VPSes download the published host bundle from `system-bundles/<CUSTOMER_VPS_IMAGE_VERSION>/`;
- Pipedream, Clerk server-side auth, provisioning, routing, and host-bundle publication stay on the platform.

Legacy Docker Compose and `/containers/*` instructions are not the production customer runtime. They are only for archived shared-container deployments or local development.

## Prerequisites

- Hetzner account and customer project quota.
- Cloudflare account with `matrix-os.com`.
- Clerk account for auth.
- Inngest/Vercel setup for signup flows where used.
- Cloudflare R2 bucket for host bundles, DB snapshots, and system metadata.
- A platform Postgres database configured by `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL` or `POSTGRES_URL`.

## Cloudflare Routing

Root `matrix-os.com` stays on Vercel. The Matrix OS runtime domains point at the platform tunnel:

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| CNAME | api | `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` |
| CNAME | app | `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` |
| CNAME | code | `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` |

`app.matrix-os.com` and `code.matrix-os.com` are session-based. The platform resolves the signed-in Clerk user to a `running` `user_machines` row before proxying to the customer VPS. Do not document or depend on per-user Matrix subdomains for the managed product.

## Required Platform Environment

Minimum platform/control-plane env:

```bash
PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
PLATFORM_SECRET=...
PLATFORM_PUBLIC_URL=https://app.matrix-os.com
MATRIX_API_ORIGIN=https://api.matrix-os.com
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_or_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_or_test_...
PLATFORM_JWT_SECRET=...

ATS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../matrix_ats
ATS_INGEST_SECRET=...
ATS_ADMIN_SECRET=...
ATS_BOOKING_BASE_URL=https://booking-provider.example/...

CUSTOMER_VPS_ENABLED=true
CUSTOMER_VPS_IMAGE_VERSION=matrix-os-host-dev
HETZNER_API_TOKEN=...
HETZNER_CUSTOMER_PROJECT=matrix-os-customers
HETZNER_LOCATION=nbg1
HETZNER_SERVER_TYPE=cpx22
HETZNER_SSH_KEY_NAME=matrix-ops

R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
R2_BUCKET=matrixos-sync
```

`MATRIX_API_ORIGIN` is a dedicated control-plane origin. It must use HTTPS in
deployed environments and must not equal an app or code shell host. The
bearer-returning runtime-selection exchange fails closed when this value is
missing or aliases a renderer-accessible host.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is required at host-bundle build time because it is baked into the Next.js shell bundle.

Production recruiting uses a dedicated database in the production Neon project.
Create the database beside the platform database, preserve the same TLS and
endpoint parameters in its connection URL, and store the three settings in
Secret Manager as `ats-database-url`, `ats-ingest-secret`, and
`ats-admin-secret`. Grant the Cloud Run service account
`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on each secret. The production deployment
preflights all three and requires `ATS_BOOKING_BASE_URL` as a production GitHub
environment variable, mounts the ATS settings into the candidate revision,
checks the authenticated ingest route, and performs a read against the ATS
database before promotion. Staging does not mount the production ATS settings.

Platform-owned integrations also need:

```bash
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_ID=...
PIPEDREAM_CLIENT_SECRET=...
PIPEDREAM_PROJECT_ID=...
PIPEDREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
```

Do not copy `PIPEDREAM_*`, Clerk server secrets, platform DB credentials, or `PLATFORM_SECRET` into customer VPS env files. Customer VPS gateways call the platform through `PLATFORM_INTERNAL_URL` with a per-host `UPGRADE_TOKEN`.

Hosted billing must be configured before promoting production Cloud Run
revisions. Missing Stripe price IDs break the signed-in no-VPS path because the
pre-VPS billing gate uses `matrix_builder` monthly checkout by default. The
public monthly catalog is Starter $20, Builder $100, and Max $200. Create new
immutable Stripe Prices at those amounts, then store their IDs in Secret
Manager with these names and grant the Cloud Run service account
`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`:

```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_STARTER_MONTHLY=stripe-price-matrix-starter-monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_STARTER_ANNUAL=stripe-price-matrix-starter-annual
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_BUILDER_MONTHLY=stripe-price-matrix-builder-monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_BUILDER_ANNUAL=stripe-price-matrix-builder-annual
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_MAX_MONTHLY=stripe-price-matrix-max-monthly
STRIPE_PRICE_MATRIX_MAX_ANNUAL=stripe-price-matrix-max-annual
STRIPE_LEGACY_PRICE_CATALOG_JSON=stripe-legacy-price-catalog-json
STRIPE_PRICE_AI_CREDIT_USD_5=stripe-price-ai-credit-usd-5
STRIPE_PRICE_AI_CREDIT_USD_10=stripe-price-ai-credit-usd-10
STRIPE_PRICE_AI_CREDIT_USD_25=stripe-price-ai-credit-usd-25
```

Annual IDs are retained only to recognize and manage existing subscriptions;
new Checkout sessions are monthly-only. The legacy catalog secret must be a
bounded JSON array such as
`[{"priceId":"price_old_builder_monthly","planSlug":"matrix_builder","interval":"monthly"}]`.
List every replaced live Price ID before changing the current monthly secrets,
so existing customers keep their original subscription and entitlement. The
current price IDs take precedence if an ID appears in both catalogs.

Stripe automatic tax is enabled in subscription Checkout. Before promotion,
verify the live account has the required tax registrations; enabling automatic
tax alone does not create registrations.

Funded AI add-on credit remains disabled unless the three one-time USD Prices,
Stripe secret/signing secret, and
`MATRIX_FUNDED_AI_ADDON_CHECKOUT_ENABLED=true` are all present. Set
`MATRIX_AI_CREDIT_STRIPE_TAX_REGISTRATIONS_VERIFIED=true` only after the Stripe
account has the required active tax registrations; otherwise add-on Checkout
deliberately creates sessions with automatic tax disabled. Use a restricted
Stripe key and, where Cloud Run has stable egress, a Stripe IP allowlist.

The two portal configurations are required to enable the customer-facing
add-computer flow, but their absence does not block an otherwise healthy
platform deployment. Configure both for subscription updates and expose only
the extra-runtime choices matching that configuration's monthly or annual
interval. The deployment rejects a partial pair, and the platform fails closed
instead of falling back to a general portal when both are absent.

The `Platform Cloud Run` workflow preflights these secrets, mounts them into
the deployed revision, smokes `/sign-in` for the pre-VPS billing shell, and
keeps production at `min-instances=1`. Staging may still scale to zero.

## Matrix-Funded AI Relay

Matrix-funded AI uses a dedicated Cloud Run service built from
`Dockerfile.ai-relay`; it does not deploy the legacy shared proxy or run on a
customer VPS. Configure its selected GitHub environment with the relay service
name and service account, the fixed Cloudflare Anthropic gateway URL, and the
internal platform origin. Store credentials only in Google Secret Manager:

```text
cloudflare-ai-gateway-token       -> relay service account only
ai-relay-metadata-secret          -> relay service account only
ai-relay-control-token            -> relay and platform service accounts
ai-funded-credential-hash-secret  -> platform service account only
```

The `AI Relay Cloud Run` workflow preflights secret versions and IAM bindings,
builds an immutable image, deploys a tagged candidate, and smokes `/health` plus
the absence of legacy proxy routes. It is preview-only until the metering and
rollback gates in spec 118 are complete.

Platform and PR-preview workflows mount the two platform secrets only when both
`MATRIX_FUNDED_AI_CONTROL_PLANE_ENABLED` and
`MATRIX_FUNDED_AI_RUNTIME_ENABLED` are `true`. They also require an HTTPS
`MATRIX_FUNDED_AI_RELAY_URL`; disabling the flags removes those secret bindings
from newly deployed revisions. Existing customer VPSes must be reprovisioned or
updated through the normal host configuration flow before they receive a new
relay origin and scoped runtime token.

## Updating Platform Auth and Device-Login Pages

`app.matrix-os.com` sign-in, sign-up, billing handoff, provisioning handoff, and
CLI/native device-login pages are served by the platform Cloud Run service.
Publishing a customer host bundle is not enough for these routes: Cloud Run
keeps serving the previously deployed image until the platform service is
rebuilt and promoted.

Deploy the platform Cloud Run service whenever a PR changes:

- `packages/platform/src/auth-routes.ts`
- `packages/platform/src/main.ts` auth, sign-in, sign-up, billing, or provisioning routes
- Clerk redirect/sign-in/sign-up environment wiring
- `distro/docker-compose.platform.yml` for `platform` or `auth-shell`
- platform pages that users reach at `app.matrix-os.com`

`.github/workflows/platform-cloud-run.yml` automatically builds, smokes, and
promotes the production Cloud Run revision on `main` when platform/app-shell
inputs change. For an immediate manual deployment, dispatch `Platform Cloud Run`
with `environment=production` and `promote=true`.

Legacy platform VPS Docker deployments should only be used if Cloud Run is not
the active serving path. On the platform VPS, keep the main checkout clean and
deploy from a manual worktree pointed at `origin/main`:

```bash
git fetch origin main
DEPLOY_SHA="$(git rev-parse --short origin/main)"
git worktree add --detach "/home/deploy/matrix-os.worktrees/platform-main-$DEPLOY_SHA" origin/main
cd "/home/deploy/matrix-os.worktrees/platform-main-$DEPLOY_SHA/distro"
docker compose -p distro \
  --env-file /home/deploy/matrix-os/.env \
  -f docker-compose.platform.yml \
  up -d --build platform \
&& cd /home/deploy/matrix-os \
&& git worktree remove --force "/home/deploy/matrix-os.worktrees/platform-main-$DEPLOY_SHA" \
&& git worktree prune
```

The existing production Compose project is named `distro`; keep `-p distro` so
Compose replaces `distro-platform-1` and does not create a second stack. The
command may also rebuild and restart `distro-auth-shell-1` because it shares the
same image build graph. Remove the temporary deploy worktree after the Compose
command succeeds so old monorepo copies do not accumulate on the platform VPS.

After the rebuild, verify the platform page actually changed:

```bash
curl -sS https://app.matrix-os.com/health
curl -sS -X POST https://app.matrix-os.com/api/auth/device/code \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"clientId":"matrixos-cli"}'

# Use the returned verificationUri. For current CLI device signup, the
# server-rendered inline HTML must contain both Clerk sign-up and sign-in
# handoff URLs back to /auth/device. These strings are not emitted by a bundled
# client build, so they are stable smoke-test anchors for this platform route.
curl -sS 'https://app.matrix-os.com/auth/device?user_code=<code>' \
  | rg "mountSignUp|signInUrl: deviceAuthUrl|signUpUrl: deviceAuthUrl"
```

If the final check has no output, `app.matrix-os.com` is still serving an old
platform image, the request is not reaching the platform container expected by
the current Compose project, or the device-auth route changed and this smoke
check needs to be updated alongside it.

## Host Bundle

Build and publish the customer VPS host bundle before provisioning or refreshing customer VPSes:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a
./scripts/build-host-bundle.sh
sha256sum dist/host-bundle/matrix-host-bundle.tar.gz
```

Publish:

```text
system-bundles/$CUSTOMER_VPS_IMAGE_VERSION/matrix-host-bundle.tar.gz
system-bundles/$CUSTOMER_VPS_IMAGE_VERSION/matrix-host-bundle.tar.gz.sha256
```

The bundle contains `/opt/matrix/app`, `/opt/matrix/runtime`, and `/opt/matrix/bin`. It includes bundled Vite/React default apps and the launchers for `matrix-gateway.service`, `matrix-shell.service`, `matrix-code.service`, `matrix-sync-agent.service`, and `matrix-update`.

## Customer VPS Provisioning

Manual smoke provision:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$PLATFORM_PUBLIC_URL/vps/provision" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PLATFORM_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clerkUserId":"user_test_vps","handle":"vps-test"}'
```

Expected flow:

1. Platform inserts or returns a `user_machines` row.
2. Platform renders cloud-init with machine env, R2 env, local Postgres password, host-bundle URL, and registration token.
3. Hetzner creates the customer VPS.
4. Cloud-init downloads and verifies the host bundle.
5. The customer VPS starts local Postgres, restores any R2 DB snapshot, starts Matrix services, and calls `/vps/register`.
6. Platform marks the machine `running`.

Status:

```bash
curl -sS "$PLATFORM_PUBLIC_URL/vps/$MACHINE_ID/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PLATFORM_SECRET"
```

## Verification

Platform:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/health
psql "$PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT handle, status, public_ipv4, image_version, last_seen_at FROM user_machines ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"
```

Customer VPS:

```bash
ssh matrix@<customer-vps-ip> 'systemctl status matrix-gateway.service matrix-shell.service matrix-code.service --no-pager'
ssh matrix@<customer-vps-ip> 'journalctl -u matrix-gateway.service -u matrix-shell.service -n 200 --no-pager'
ssh matrix@<customer-vps-ip> 'grep -E "^(PLATFORM_INTERNAL_URL|UPGRADE_TOKEN|MATRIX_HANDLE|DATABASE_URL)=" /opt/matrix/env/host.env'
ssh matrix@<customer-vps-ip> 'pg_isready --host=127.0.0.1 --username=matrix --dbname=matrix'
```

App data verification:

```bash
ssh matrix@<customer-vps-ip> \
  'curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/bridge/query \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"action\":\"listApps\",\"app\":\"_\"}"'
```
